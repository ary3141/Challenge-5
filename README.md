# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Core Motion Rep Counter  

This project is an **Apple Watch app** that uses **Core Motion** to automatically count exercise repetitions.  
It streams data from the watch's accelerometer in real time, applies a **live peak detection algorithm**,  
and counts reps after each completed set.

## Features  

- **Real-time motion data** streaming from Apple Watch  
- **Live rep detection** with peak analysis  
- **Set-based counting** ‚Äì reps are recorded after you complete a set  

## Tech Stack  

- **SwiftUI** ‚Äì clean & reactive user interface  
- **Core Motion** ‚Äì access to accelerometer & gyroscope data  
- **Combine** ‚Äì observe and process motion updates in real time  

## How It Works  

1. The watch continuously collects **motion data** (accelerometer + gyroscope).  
2. A **peak detection algorithm** detects reps as you move.  
3. After a set is completed, the watch **finalizes rep count** based on detected peaks.  
4. The result is displayed **live** on your watch.  

## Learning Journey  

I approached this project by:  
- Breaking the problem into **small, testable steps**  
- Researching **Core Motion** and **peak detection** using Apple Docs & forums  
- Testing directly on my **Apple Watch** until the detection felt accurate  

## Next Steps  

- Add support for **multiple exercise types**  
- Improve **noise filtering** to avoid false counts  
- Store results in **HealthKit** for progress tracking  
- Create a more detailed **visual dashboard** for workouts
